                    <p class="wow fadeInUp"  data-wow-delay="1.5s">Hello üëã! my name is Mahendra Dewangan, a student developer from India currently pursuing Bachelors of Technology in Computer Science & Engineering (2024). I'm a junior Web - Developer & Designer. I can design and develop beautiful web pages. I love to explore the field of Technology. <b>I like being simple and replicating this through my code via minimal design</b>. One day, I hope to bring a positive impact on the lives of millions of people through my code:)</p>
                    <p class="wow fadeInUp"  data-wow-delay="1.5s">Living with passion is what I strictly adhere to. ‚ÄúAlways do what you love‚Äù how much ever hackneyed this sounds it holds absolutely true. That's why I travel a lot. Not for the sole reason of ‚Äúloving‚Äù to travel but it helps me to get rid of the world and escape into a different dimension of my own. As I am a travel freak I love freezing the moments I relish. The art of capturing photos is something I am always fascinated by.</p>
                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1.5s">I am a continuous learner. Learning for me equates to exploring new ideas and growing as an individual. I just cannot imagine my life devoid of designing. I freely express my creativity and imagination by designing and code.</p>
